## What is a Better Chlorophyll Fluorometer?  A poster for Ocean Sciences 2022.


Chlorophyll fluorometers are inexpensive, easy to use, and consume little power. Their deployment in global and regional observation systems forms a basis for understanding primary production and ocean carbon cycles via estimates of chlorophyll concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Yet studies have shown large global biases in estimates of chlorophyll concentration based on fluorometry<sup>[1](#roesler2017)</sup>. What can we learn from our knowledge of spectral absorption of various phytoplankton photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments both common to, and diverse across, various species that can help produce a fluorometer with less global variability? How can we create a calibration standard for fluorometers that leads to open, traceable, and repeatable calibrations that correspond to a global mean? We present some design ideas, calibration experiments, and in situ field results that light the way towards the "better chlorophyll fluorometer".
